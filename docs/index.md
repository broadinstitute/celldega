Celldega is a spatial analysis and visualization library that is being developed by the <a href='https://www.broadinstitute.org/spatial-technology-platform' target='_blank'>Spatial Technology Platform</a> at the <a href='https://www.broadinstitute.org/spatial-technology-platform' target='_blank'>Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard</a>.

The project enables researchers to easily visualize large ST datasets (e.g., datasets with >100M transcripts) alongside single-cell and spatial analysis workflows (e.g., integrating with <a href='https://scverse.org/' target='_blank'>sverse</a> tools and utilizing novel spatial analysis approaches).

## Overview

Celldega can be used as a Python library in a Jupyter notebook environment or as a stand-alone JavaScript library for creating visualizations.
