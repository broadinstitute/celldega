# Celldega File Formats
While there has been tremendous progress in developing standardized data formats and architectures for spatial-omics data, namely [SpatialData](https://spatialdata.scverse.org/en/stable/) and the related [AnnData](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), these approaches currently lack support for interactive cloud-based visualization of large (>100M transcripts) Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) data. Furthermore, all-in-one data format approaches preclude the development of more efficient visualization-specific data formats.

The Celldega project addresses these challenges with the development of a new ST data format called LandscapeFiles, specifically built for cloud-based visualization. LandscapeFiles support Celldega's Landscape visualization method by leveraging compact [image formats](../technologies/index.md/#webp) and [cloud-native data formats](../technologies/index.md/#apache-parquet) to enable efficient storage and visualization of image (e.g., microscopy images) and vectorized data (e.g., transcript coordinates). This approach is highly scalable, enabling the visualization of very large ST datasets (>400M transcripts), while remaining compact enough that LandscapeFiles for an entire Xenium dataset can be hosted in a [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/broadinstitute/celldega_Xenium_Prime_Human_Skin_FFPE_outs/).
