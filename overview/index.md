# Overview

The Celldega library is being developed to help researchers easily visualize and analyze high-dimensional spatial-omics data in the context of a notebook workflow. Initial development has been focused on spatial transcriptomics visualization.

Celldega can be used as a Python library in a Jupyter notebook environment or as a stand-alone JavaScript library for creating visualizations.
