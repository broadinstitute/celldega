## Python
The Celldega library can be installed using pip

Celldega can be installed using pip:

```

Celldega can also be installed with the optional pre-processing requirements (e.g., vips for image pre-processing) using:
```
pip install celldega[pre]
```

## JavaScript

Celldega can be used in a JavaScript environment such as ObservableHQ by importing it as a module from content delivery networks like esm.sh:

celldega = await import('https://esm.sh/celldega@latest')
```

Or by importing it from a local file

```
import celldega from 'js/widget.js'
```
