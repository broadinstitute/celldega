# Overview

Celldega enables researchers to easily visualize large ST datasets (e.g., datasets with >100M transcripts) alongside single-cell and spatial analysis notebook workflows (e.g., integrating with <a href='https://scverse.org/' target='_blank'>sverse</a> tools and utilizing novel spatial analysis approaches).

Celldega can be used as a Python library in a Jupyter notebook environment or as a stand-alone JavaScript library for creating visualizations.
